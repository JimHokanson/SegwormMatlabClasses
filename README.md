SegWorm - Matlab Classes
=======

SegWorm is Matlab code from Dr. Eviatar Yemini built as part of the WormBehavior database (http://wormbehavior.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)

This version of the code is an attempt to rewrite/clean up the code by using classes and packages to better encapsulate functionality.

The code organization is still a bit in flux as I wrap my head around what code is coming from where.

Current Efforts

- started rewriting parsing code, nearly finished
- started rewriting calculation of features - this is what I am currently working on
- went through statistical files but haven't yet started rewriting them
