function cleanWorm(obj)
%cleanWorm Clean up the worm contour by connecting any splits ends.
%
%   cleanWorm()
%
%   Note: the worm's contour is still rough, especially at any split ends.
%         Therefore, index lengths, as opposed to chain-code lengths, are
%         used as the distance metric over the worm's contour.
%
%   Inputs:
%       contour     - the clockwise, circularly-connected worm contour.
%       wormSegSize - the size (in contour points) of a worm segment.
%                     Note: The worm's contour is roughly divided into 50
%                     segments of musculature (i.e., hinges that represent
%                     degrees of freedom).
%                     Warning: before cleaning, the length of the contour
%                     can vary significantly: from 1/4 its correct size, if
%                     the worm is coiled up with its head and tail touching 
%                     its body, 180 degrees apart on the coil; to 2 times
%                     its correct size, if the head and tail are both split
%                     by invaginations that reach 1/4 into its body.
%                     Additionally, there are various permutations in
%                     between these extremes. Therefore, we use carefully
%                     chosen approximations that are fail-safe to within a
%                     large margin. Moreover, we use several other tricks
%                     to ensure we don't incorrectly heal false worm splits
%                     (e.g., we check for a sharp concavity before joining
%                     sharp convexities). But, we remain labile in extreme
%                     cases (e.g., omega bends where the head and tail are
%                     very proximal).
%
%   Output:
%       contour - the cleaned up worm contour.
