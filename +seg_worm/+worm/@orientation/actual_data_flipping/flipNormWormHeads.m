%       vulvaContours    - the worms' normalized vulval-side contours

%                          the vulva; in contrast, previously in the worm

%                          towards the side clockwise from the worm's head

%                               the coil, the other half of the contour is
%                               outside it)
%                          1+ = the contour is touching itself to form the
%                               coil; the specific number represents the
