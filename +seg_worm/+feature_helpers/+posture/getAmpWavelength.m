function [ampt, wavelengths, trackLength, ampRatio] = getAmpWavelength(theta, skelCoords, wormLen)
% GETAMPWAVELENGTH This function computes the amplitude and the wavelength
% for the skeleton as described in Cronin et al paper.
% Input:
%       theta - the angle of theh worm
%       skelCoords - x and y coordinates for the skeleton in absolute
%       values
%       wormLen - wormLength
%       axesName - the name of the axes that will be used to draw the
%       resukt
%       verbose - flag to either draw the bounding box or not
%       item_selected - which item is selected in the GUI
%       frameNo - frame number
%Output:
%       ampt - ampliture
%       wavelnth - wavelength

% Note: This code was taken directly from matlab code published by Cronin
% et al. in this publication:

% It was received from Cronin from personal communication and his agreement
% to use it was received.
% It is therefore not owend or claimed to be owned by creators of the Worm
% Analysis Toolbox at Schafer lab, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology
%
% These two features as they are describe in Cronin et al code:
%   - ampt - vector containing the instantaneous wormtrack amplitudes
%               or, more precisely, at each "time" the width of a
%               bounding box aligned with the worm's velocity vector
%               (the direction the rear 2/3 of the worm is traveling
%               at that moment).
%           - TJ: Here, however, we use the angle that is achieved from the
%           best fit ellipse which is much less noisy when compared to the
%           velocity vector. The angle comes as an input to this function.
%
%   - wavelnth - vector contaning the instantaneous wormtrack
%               wavelengths.  Calculated by: at each time snapshot,
%               aligning the worm's velocity vector with the x-axis,
%               performing a spatial (as opposed to temporal) fast
%               Fourier transform (FFT) for the y-coordinates of the
%               worm's posture (yielding cycles/pixel), inverting
%               (to get pixels/cycle), and scaling to the desired units.
%               - TJ: Once again instead of the velocity vector angle we
%               will use an angle obtained from best fit elipse analysis.
