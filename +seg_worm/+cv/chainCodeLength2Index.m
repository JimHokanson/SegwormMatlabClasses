function indices = chainCodeLength2Index(lengths, chainCodeLengths)
%CHAINCODELENGTH2INDEX Translate a length into an index. The index
%   represents the numerically-closest element to the desired length in
%   an ascending array of chain code lengths.
%
%   INDICES = CHAINCODELENGTH2INDEX(LENGTHS, CHAINCODELENGTHS)
%
%   Inputs:
%       lengths          - the lengths to translate into indices
%       chainCodeLengths - an ascending array of chain code lengths
%                          Note: the chain code lengths must increase at
%                          every successive index
%
%   Output:
%       indices - the indices for the elements closest to the desired
%                 lengths
