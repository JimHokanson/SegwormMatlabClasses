    %   Class:
    %   seg_worm.feature.event_ss

    %   I was going to leave this as a structure but there is at least one
    %   method that comes from this and it will be a nice way to
    %   encapsulate some things
    %
    %   See Also:
    %   seg_worm.feature.event_finder
    %   seg_worm.feature.event
    
    properties
       start_Is
       end_Is
    end
    
    methods
       %seg_worm.events.events2stats - move here
       %fromStruct - from the old struct version ...
    end
